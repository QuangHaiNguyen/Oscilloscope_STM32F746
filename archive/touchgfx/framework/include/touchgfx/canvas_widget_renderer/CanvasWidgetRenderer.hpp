     * @brief Memory reporting.
     *
     *        Memory reporting can be turned on (and off) using this method. CWR will try to
     *        work with the given amount of memory passed when calling setupBuffer(). If the
     *        outline of the figure is too complex, this will be reported.
     *
     *        "CWR requires X bytes" means that X bytes is the highest number of bytesd requied
     *        by CWR so far, but since the size of the invalidated area and the shape of things
     *        draw can influence this, this may be reported several times with a higher and
     *        higher number. Leave your app running for a long time to find out what the memory
     *        requirements are.
     *
     *        "CWR requires X bytes (Y bytes missing)" means the same as the report above, but
     *        there as was not enough memory to render the entire shape. To get around this,
     *        CWR will split the shape into two separate drawings of half size. This means that
     *        less memory is required, but drawing will be (somewhat)
     *        slower. After you see this message all future draws will be split into smaller
     *        chunks, so memory requirements might not get as high. This is followed by:
     *
     *        "CWR will split draw into multiple draws due to limited memory." actually just means
     *        that CWR will try to work with a smaller amount of memory.
     *
     *        In general, if there is enough memory available to run the simulation and never
     *        see the message "CWR will split draw ...", this is preferred. The size of the
     *        buffer required will be the highest number X reported as "CWR requires X bytes".
     *        Good numbers can also be around half of X.
