 * @brief Class for optimizing and wrapping move and zoom operations on ScalableImages.
 *
 *        Class for optimizing and wrapping move and zoom operations on ScalableImages. The
 *        ZoomAnimationImage takes two bitmaps representing the same image but at a small and a
 *        large resolution. These bitmaps should be the sizes that are used when not animating
 *        the image. The ZoomAnimationImage will use an Image for displaying the bitmap when
 *        its width and height matches one of them. When it does not it will use a
 *        ScalableImage instead. The main idea is that the supplied bitmaps should be the end
 *        points of the zoom animation so that it ends up using an Image when not animating.
 *        This is, however, not a required. You can animate from and to sizes that are not
 *        equal the sizes of the bitmaps. The result is a container that has the high
 *        performance of an ordinary image when the size matches the prerendered bitmaps.
 *        Moreover it supplies easy to use animation functions that lets you zoom and move the
 *        image.
 *
 * @note Note that since this container uses the ScalableImage it has the same restrictions. That
 *       means no 1 bit per pixel mode.
