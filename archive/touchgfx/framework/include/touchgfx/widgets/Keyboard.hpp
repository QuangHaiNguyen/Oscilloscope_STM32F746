 * @class Keyboard Keyboard.hpp touchgfx/widgets/Keyboard.hpp
 *
 * @brief The keyboard provides text input for touch devices.
 *
 *        The keyboard provides text input for touch devices. It is configured using a Layout
 *        and a KeyMappingList, which both can be changed at runtime. The class using the
 *        keyboard must provide a buffer where the entered text is placed. The Layout contains
 *        a bitmap id for the image to display and two mappings: rectangles to key ids and
 *        rectangles to callback methods.
 *
 *        The KeyMappingList maps key ids to unicode characters. When the user presses a key,
 *        the keyboard looks in its layout for a rectangle containing the coordinates pressed.
 *        If it finds a mapping to a callback method, it will invoke that method. If it finds a
 *        mapping to a key it will look up the unicode character for that key and place it in a
 *        text buffer. The sequence is: (x,y) -> KeyId -> UnicodeChar.
 *
 *        A keyboard with multiple key mappings e.g. lower case alpha, upper case alpha and
 *        numeric mappings can be created by implementing callback methods for shift and mode
 *        areas in the provided bitmap and then changing the KeyMappingList when those areas
 *        are pressed.
