 * @brief The Drawable class is an abstract definition of something that can be drawn.
 *
 *        The Drawable class is an abstract definition of something that can be drawn. In the
 *        composite design pattern, the Drawable is the component interface. Drawables can be
 *        added to a screen as a tree structure through the leaf node class Widget and the
 *        Container class. A Drawable contains a pointer to its next sibling and a pointer to
 *        its parent node. These are maintained by the Container to which the Drawable is added.
 *
 *        The Drawable interface contains two pure virtual functions which must be implemented
 *        by widgets, namely draw() and getSolidRect(). In addition it contains general
 *        functionality for receiving events and navigating the tree structure.
 *
 *        The coordinates of a Drawable are always relative to its parent node.
