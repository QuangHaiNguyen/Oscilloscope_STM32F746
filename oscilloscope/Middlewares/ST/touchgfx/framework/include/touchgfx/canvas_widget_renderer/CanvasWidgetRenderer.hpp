     * with the given amount of memory passed when calling setupBuffer(). If the outline of
     * the figure is too complex, this will be reported.
     *
     * "CWR requires X bytes" means that X bytes is the highest number of bytes required by
     * CWR so far, but since the size of the invalidated area and the shape of things draw
     * can influence this, this may be reported several times with a higher and higher
     * number. Leave your app running for a long time to find out what the memory
     * requirements are.
     *
     * "CWR requires X bytes (Y bytes missing)" means the same as the report above, but
     * there as was not enough memory to render the entire shape. To get around this, CWR
     * will split the shape into two separate drawings of half size. This means that less
     * memory is required, but drawing will be (somewhat)
     * slower. After you see this message all future draws will be split into smaller chunks,
     * so memory requirements might not get as high. This is followed by:
     *
     * "CWR will split draw into multiple draws due to limited memory." actually just means
     * that CWR will try to work with a smaller amount of memory.
     *
     * In general, if there is enough memory available to run the simulation and never see
     * the message "CWR will split draw ...", this is preferred. The size of the buffer
     * required will be the highest number X reported as "CWR requires X bytes". Good
     * numbers can also be around half of X.
