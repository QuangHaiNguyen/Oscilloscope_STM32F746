 * The Drawable class is an abstract definition of something that can be drawn. In the composite
 * design pattern, the Drawable is the component interface. Drawables can be added to a
 * screen as a tree structure through the leaf node class Widget and the Container
 * class. A Drawable contains a pointer to its next sibling and a pointer to its parent
 * node. These are maintained by the Container to which the Drawable is added.
 *
 * The Drawable interface contains two pure virtual functions which must be implemented
 * by widgets, namely draw() and getSolidRect(). In addition it contains general
 * functionality for receiving events and navigating the tree structure.
 *
 * The coordinates of a Drawable are always relative to its parent node.
